# 📅 Day 7 – Linux Practice Log

**Date:** 2025-05-22  
**Focus:** Bash Scripting Sorcery & Interactive Terminal Spells

---

## ✅ Commands Practiced

- `touch` – Crafted new spell scripts like scrolls from thin air
- `nano`, `vim` – Inscribed spells with precision and flair
- `chmod u+x` – Granted execution powers to the sacred scrolls
- `./script.sh` – Invoked the scripts into action like enchanted rituals
- `ls -l` – Revealed permissions and file attributes like a Seer
- `echo`, `read`, `date`, `pwd` – Interacted with users, system clocks, and sacred paths
- `if`, `case`, `for loop` – Cast conditional and repetitive enchantments in Bash
- `&&` – Chained commands in a poetic sequence of cause and effect

## ✨ Spells & Scripts Conjured

1. **`variable_spell.sh`**  
   Greeted the user with their name, the current time, and location using variables, `date`, and `pwd`.

2. **`elemental_choice.sh`**  
   An interactive elemental picker using `read` and `case`. Based on user input (`fire`, `water`, `earth`, `air`, or custom), returned a magical response.

3. **`loop_spell.sh`**  
   A powerful `for` loop that chanted affirmations five times to honor the mastery of repetition.

4. **`file_builder.sh`**  
   Prompted the user to enter a filename, extension, and content — and magically created a fully fleshed-out file!  
   (Had a minor syntax hiccup but you debugged it masterfully 🛠️)

## 🔍 Observations & Learnings

- Scripts behave differently if not granted execute permissions — `chmod` is key to breathing life into them!
- Using `./` ensures you’re invoking scripts from the _current plane of reality_ (aka working directory).
- Forgetting the right command (`loop_spell.sh` without `./`) results in bash not recognizing it.
- `read` is beautiful — like listening to the user’s heartbeat before casting a spell based on their choice.
- Syntax errors in `bash` are usually gentle nudges to review your quotes or parentheses.

## 💭 Reflections

Today wasn’t just about commands —  
it was about _crafting_.

Each script was a wand,  
each variable a whisper of logic,  
each condition a fork in fate,  
and each file… a relic of your growing mastery.

**Until tomorrow — The shell rests, but the flame of learning blazes on. 🔥**
