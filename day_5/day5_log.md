**Date:** 2025-05-20  
**Focus:** JavaScript Practice Day – Terminal Usage through JS Projects

## ✅ Commands Practiced (as part of JS development flow)

- `cd` – Navigated into project directories  
- `ls` – Listed files to check JavaScript and HTML files  
- `node script.js` – Executed JavaScript files with Node.js  
- `code .` – Opened VSCode directly from the terminal  
- `clear` – Cleaned up terminal for better visibility  
- `touch` – Created JavaScript practice files (`script.js`)  
- `mkdir` – Created folders like `dom_playground` for JS tasks

## 💭 Reflections

Although today was mainly dedicated to diving deeper into **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **event delegation**, the Linux terminal walked hand-in-hand with me as always.

I used it to:

- Navigate between project files  
- Run and debug JS files  
- Create folders for organized practice  

So while I didn’t learn new Linux commands today, I *lived with them* — and that’s valuable! Tomorrow, we’ll shift gears and do a dedicated Linux session again. Until then, this journal marks the effort and spirit of persistence ✨🐧🔥
