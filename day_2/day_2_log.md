"Small commands, mighty power — today I laid the bricks of control."

## 🔹Command Line Basics — Revisited & Refined

- Today’s journey was all about walking through the essential Linux commands — not just learning, but feeling the power of each one as it shaped the filesystem like clay in a sculptor’s hands.

---

## 🧰 Commands Practiced with Purpose:

**Command | Purpose | Example**

- pwd || Prints the current working directory || pwd
- ls, ls -l, ls -a || Lists directory contents (detailed or hidden if flagged) || ls -l, ls -a
- cd, cd ~, cd .., cd /path/to/dir || Changes the working directory. || cd ~/Documents, cd ..
- mkdir || Creates a new directory. || mkdir projects
- rmdir || Removes an empty directory. || rmdir old_folder
- rm || Removes a file. || rm notes.txt
- rm -r || Removes a directory and its contents. || rm -r junk_folder
- touch || Creates a new file. || touch hello.txt
- cat || Displays file content. || cat hello.txt
- nano || Opens a file in a simple text editor. || nano notes.txt
- vim || Opens a file in the powerful Vim editor. || vim code.js
- echo || Outputs text or writes content into a file. || echo "Hello" > greet.txt
- cp || Copies files or directories. || cp file1.txt copy.txt
- mv || Moves or renames files. || mv old.txt archive/ or mv file.txt renamed.txt

---

## 🔎 Key Learning Notes:

- Navigation is the soul of Linux command-line usage.
- Creating, removing, and managing files/directories is now second nature.
- Began exploring text editors like nano and vim — felt the raw power of terminal editing.
- Realized how echo can be creatively used to inject content into files — automation vibes!

---

## 🔧 Practical Task:

- Created a personal playground of folders and files to experiment with each command.
- Practiced writing content to files and viewing/editing them via CLI.
- Applied nested file operations using rm -r, cp, mv.

---

## 🧠 Reflection of the Day:

- “Today, the terminal stopped being a stranger and became a companion — obedient to every keystroke, opening doors with every command.”
