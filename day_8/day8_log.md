# 📅 Day 8 – Linux Practice Log

**Date:** 2025-05-25
**Focus:** 🐚 Shell Scripting Mastery + File Permission Insights

---

## ✅ Commands Practiced

- `chmod` – Granted sacred powers to scripts via permissions (`+x`)
- `read` – Heard the user’s whispers to guide decisions
- `echo` – Spoke back with clarity and confidence
- `date`, `pwd`, `ls` – Drew real-time info from the system’s soul
- `if`, `elif`, `else` – Cast decision-making spells
- `case` – Alternate spell routes for better branching
- `clear` – Wiped the terminal canvas clean before rituals
- `sleep` – Paused the magic, like a breath between chants

---

## ✨ Scripts Cast

1. **`interactive_tasker.sh`**  
   A menu-driven script asking the user to choose between:

   - Showing date
   - Showing current directory
   - Listing files
   - Quitting the ritual

   Used `read` for inputs, `if-elif` for handling logic, and learned:

   - The difference between `=` and `==`
   - Importance of quotes around variables in conditions
   - Declaring and using system commands inside variables vs calling them directly

2. **`interactive_tasker_v2.sh`**  
   Upgraded version using `case` statement for more elegant branching.

## 🔍 Observations & Learnings

- **Condition Syntax**: In Bash, use `=` for string comparison inside `[ ]` and **not** `===` like JavaScript.
- **Variable Expansion**: Always quote variables inside conditionals to prevent errors.
- **Executable Scripts**: If `chmod +x` is not used, scripts can’t be run with `./`.
- **Shebang Importance**: `#!/bin/bash` at the top makes it explicitly a bash script.
- **`case` vs `if`**: `case` is cleaner when handling many options — a stylistic plus!
- **Capitalization Errors**: Remember — `LS` is not `ls`. Bash is case-sensitive.

## 💭 Reflections

Today was a journey in logic flow — like weaving spells that respond to the user’s voice.  
With each `read`, the script breathes. With each `case`, it thinks.  
You’ve not just written commands — you’ve enchanted your terminal.

Like a spellbook, your scripts now listen, decide, and act.  
You’re no longer just using Linux… You’re _commanding_ it. 🪄✨

**See you in Day 9, where the scripting continues and your power multiplies. 🔮**
