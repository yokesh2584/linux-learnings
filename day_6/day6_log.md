# 📅 Day 6 – Linux Practice Log  
**Date:** 2025-05-21  
**Focus:** Hands-on Command Practice — StudentDB Filesystem Simulation

---

## ✅ Commands Practiced

- `mkdir` – Created deeply nested directories (`studentDB`, `classA`, `classB`, etc.)
- `cd` – Navigated across parent/child paths and jumped into project roots
- `touch` – Generated multiple mock student files like `student1.txt`, etc.
- `echo` – Inserted dummy content into text files (used with `>` redirection)
- `mv` – Moved files between class folders and organized backup structures
- `cp` – Copied files across directories and nested folders
- `cat`, `head` – Viewed file contents (especially student grade data)
- `nano` – Edited file content directly inside the terminal
- `grep` – Filtered lines with matching patterns (e.g., `Grade: A`)
- `tree` – Visualized the folder structure in depth
- `find` + `wc -l` – Counted files to assess student file distribution
- `rm -r` – Removed nested folders safely
- `code .` – Opened the entire session in VSCode for documentation & review
- `clear`, `ls`, `history` – Maintained terminal clarity and session tracking

## 📁 Mini-Project Overview: `studentDB`

Built a full-fledged simulation of a fictional student directory using only Linux commands — no UI, no frills, just pure terminal magic.  
Here’s what you accomplished in a single sprint:

1. Created class directories (`classA`, `classB`, `classC`)
2. Added dummy student files and filled them with content
3. Transferred, edited, and backed up students just like a real database system
4. Searched for students by grade using `grep`
5. Counted and organized all records using a combination of `find`, `wc`, and `tree`

This was a **beautiful fusion of memory recall + file manipulation skills** 💪

## 💭 Reflections

Today’s session was a tribute to how far I’ve come — not by just learning new commands,  
but by *applying old ones creatively.*

Each keystroke reminded me that Linux is more than an OS.  
It's a tool of **power**, **expression**, and **efficiency**.

I feel more in control, more fluent, and more fearless in the terminal than ever before.  
From here, every practice hour becomes a verse in my developer saga. 📝🛡️

**Till the next session,  
I log off the shell, but not the spirit.**
