| **Distribution** | A complete OS built on the Linux kernel, bundled with software. | Ubuntu, SUSE, RHEL |
| **Boot Loader** | Program that initiates the OS boot process. | GRUB, ISOLINUX |
| **Service** | A background process running in the system. | `httpd`, `ntpd`, `ftpd`, `named` |
| **Filesystem** | Defines how data is stored and retrieved. | ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, Btrfs |
| **X Window System** | Provides graphical functionality to Linux. | Common on most distros |
| **Desktop Environment** | User interface layer on top of Linux. | GNOME, KDE, Xfce, Fluxbox |

## 🔹 3. Linux Basics & System Startup

> *(Covered briefly in the first hour — deeper insights to follow in next sessions)*

- The system boots via the **boot loader**, loading the **kernel** into memory.
- Kernel then loads **system services** and mounts the **filesystem**.
- User lands in either the **command line shell** or **desktop environment**, depending on setup.
