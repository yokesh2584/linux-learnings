# 🐧 Linux Learnings by Yokesh

Welcome to my **Linux learning journey**! This repository is a digital garden where I’m planting seeds of knowledge about the Linux operating system — one day, one command, and one insight at a time.

## 📚 What’s This Repo About?

This repository is dedicated to:
- Learning Linux from scratch through practical tutorials and hands-on practice.
- Documenting everyday learnings as daily logs.
- Comparing different Linux families like Debian (Ubuntu), Red Hat (RHEL), and SUSE.
